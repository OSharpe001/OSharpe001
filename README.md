  I'm currently a Union Electrician with a new found love for coding and  I'm looking to make a transition, regarding my career. 
  I've recently finished a few (beginner level) certs, through coursera, for Python. looking to build my experience, on the side, while working full time.
  I understand that entry level positions will not replace my current career's sallary. Instead, I plan to improve my skills until my IT career can match and (of course) exceed my current career's cap.
  Thanks for taking the time. . .
