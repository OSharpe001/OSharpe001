  I'm a former NYC Union Electrician with a new found L❤️VE for coding and I'm looking to make a transition, regarding my career. 
  I've recently finished a Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp and more than a few specializations through Coursera (and other online coding courses), for Python, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Django, PHP, Mongo-DB, Express, React, Node, etc. Looking to build my experience, and find placement in Web-Development.
  Thanks for taking the time. . .
