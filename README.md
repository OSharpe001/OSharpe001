  I'm formerly a NYC Union Electrician with a new found love for coding and  I'm looking to make a transition, regarding my career. 
  I've recently finished a few certs, through coursera, for Python, PostgreSQL and Django. Looking to build my experience, anmd find a full time career.
  I understand that entry level positions will not replace my former career's sallary. Still, I plan to improve my skills until my IT career can match and (of course) exceed my current career's cap.
  Thanks for taking the time. . .
