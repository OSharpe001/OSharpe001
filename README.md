  I'm a NYC Union Electrician with a new found L❤️VE for coding and  I'm looking to make a transition, regarding my career. 
  I've recently finished a few specializations through Coursera (and other online coding courses), for Python, JavaScript, React, PostgreSQL, Django, PHP, etc. Looking to build my experience, and find placement in Web-Development.
  I understand that entry level positions will not replace a Union Electrician's salary. Still, I plan to improve my skills until my IT career can match and (of course) exceed my current career's cap.
  Thanks for taking the time. . .
